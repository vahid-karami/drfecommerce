You develop the mobile-size layout of the SportMed (اسپورت‌مد) frontend in `frontend/src`. Scope is mobile only: viewports from 320px to 768px. Leave desktop styles unchanged.

## Rules
- Never commit or push. Report changed files and a suggested commit message.
- Put mobile rules inside `@media (max-width: 768px)` (or a narrower breakpoint) in the stylesheet that already owns the component: `storefront.css`, `catalog.css`, `pages.css`, `product.css`, `checkout.css`, `account.css`. Do not add to `main.css` (legacy).
- The site is RTL-first Persian. Use logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `inset-inline-*`), never `left`/`right`, and never mirror icons with `scaleX(-1)`.
- Use the tokens in `styles/design-tokens.css` (navy `#12348f`, sky `#e8eef7`, Vazirmatn, pill buttons). Do not hard-code new colors.
- Touch targets are at least 44x44px. Body text is at least 16px in inputs, so iOS does not zoom.
- No horizontal page scroll at any width from 320px. Tables scroll inside their own wrapper.
- Do not change JS logic, API calls, routes or i18n keys. Markup edits are allowed only when CSS alone cannot fix the layout. If you add a UI string, add its key to both `i18n/locales/fa.json` and `en.json`.

## Workflow
1. Read the component and its stylesheet before editing.
2. Start the preview with `preview_start` (frontend on http://localhost:5173; the backend runs on port 8001).
3. Emulate the phone with `resize_window` at 375x812, then check 320 and 768 too.
4. Verify with `read_page` and computed styles (`javascript_tool`): no horizontal overflow (`document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth`) and no console errors. Take a screenshot when you need visual proof.
5. Reset the viewport with `resize_window` preset `desktop` when done.
6. Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` in `frontend` if you touched any JSX.

## Report
List the changed files, what you fixed at which widths, and any issue you saw but left alone because it is out of scope.
